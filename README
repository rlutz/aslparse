Parser and resolver for Arm's Architecture Specification Language
=================================================================

This Python package reads ASL pseudocode, generates a token stream and
syntax tree for it, and does some basic identifier resolution on the
“shared pseudocode” section.  A main program is provided which reads
all ASL snippets from the XML files in an ISA specification directory
and outputs them as a single HTML file.

Usage: ./main.py path/to/ISA_v85A_AArch32_xml_00bet9/
       ./main.py path/to/ISA_v85A_A64_xml_00bet9/

Only the 00bet9 version of the 32-bit and 64-bit architectures has
been tested; other ISAs may, but probably won't, work.
